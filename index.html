        <p>
            A Database Management System (DBMS) is essential software that facilitates the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data within databases. It provides a structured way to manage data, ensuring efficient handling of vast amounts of information. Key concepts in DBMS include databases, SQL (Structured Query Language), transactions, normalization, and ACID properties, which ensure reliable and consistent data transactions. There are various types of DBMS, such as Relational DBMS (RDBMS), which uses tables and SQL for data manipulation; NoSQL DBMS, designed for large-scale data across distributed systems with types like document-based, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases; Object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS), which stores data as objects; and Hierarchical and Network DBMS, which organize data in tree-like and graph structures respectively. A DBMS manages data storage, retrieval, and updates, user administration, data integrity, backup, and recovery, and performance tuning. It offers advantages like reduced data redundancy, data sharing, security, consistency, and efficient access, though it can be complex, costly, and sometimes slower for specific applications. Popular DBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, and Neo4j, each catering to different needs and preferences in data management.

            <h3>Table</h3>
            <p>
                A table is a fundamental component of a relational database, consisting of rows and columns that organize data into a structured format. Each row, also known as a record or tuple, represents a single entity or instance, while each column, known as a field or attribute, represents a specific piece of data about that entity. Tables allow for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, as they enable querying, sorting, and filtering based on various criteria. The structure of a table is defined by its schema, which includes the column names, data types, and any constraints like primary keys (unique identifiers for rows) and foreign keys (references to primary keys in other tables). This organization supports data integrity and relationships between different datasets, making tables a crucial element in managing and utilizing relational databases effectively.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
            <h3>Tuple(s)</h3>
            <p>
                A tuple in database terminology is a single row within a table, representing a unique record. Each tuple consists of multiple fields or attributes, corresponding to the columns of the table. For instance, in an employee table, a tuple might contain an employee's ID, name, position, and salary. This structured format allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Tuples are fundamental to relational databases, ensuring organized data storage and easy querying. They support data integrity and relationships between datasets, making them essential for managing and utilizing relational data effectively.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
            <h3>Field(s)</h3>
            <p>
                In the context of databases, a field refers to a specific piece of data within a table or record. Each field corresponds to a column in a table and represents a single attribute of the entities or records stored in that table. For example, in a table storing employee information, fields might include EmployeeID, Name, Position, and Salary. Fields are defined by their data types (e.g., integer, string, date) and can have additional properties such as constraints (e.g., unique, not null) that enforce data integrity rules. Fields allow databases to organize and store detailed information efficiently, facilitating accurate data retrieval and manipulation through queries and operations.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
            <h3>Domain(s)</h3>
            <p>
                In the context of databases, a domain refers to the set of possible values that a column or attribute in a table can hold. It defines the allowable range of values for a specific field based on its data type and constraints. For example, a domain for a column storing ages might specify that the values must be integers between 0 and 150. Domains help enforce data integrity by restricting the type and range of data that can be stored in a database, ensuring consistency and validity. They are fundamental to database design and schema definition, providing guidelines for how data should be structured and maintained within a relational database management system (DBMS).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
            <h3>Constraint(s)</h3>
            <p>
                Constraints in databases enforce rules to ensure data integrity and validity. They define limits on data types, uniqueness, and relationships between tables. Primary key constraints enforce unique identification of rows, while foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity across tables. Unique constraints prevent duplicate values, and not null constraints mandate data presence in specified columns. Check constraints allow custom conditions for data validation. These rules ensure that databases store accurate, consistent, and reliable data, supporting effective data management and application functionality. Constraints are essential in maintaining data quality and enforcing business rules within relational database systems.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
            <h3>Key(s)</h3>
            <p>
                Keys in databases are essential for maintaining data integrity and relationships between tables. The primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table, ensuring no duplicates and enabling efficient data retrieval. Foreign keys establish connections between tables by referencing the primary key of another table, maintaining referential integrity. Unique keys ensure that values in specified columns are distinct across rows, similar to primary keys but allowing multiple unique constraints per table. These key types collectively enforce data consistency, support relational operations, and contribute to effective database management and application functionality, making them crucial components in relational database design.
